# Using React or any other framework instead of HTML Templates

In case of using React, Vue or any other framework, it's recommended to run [bin/prepare_other_frontend](../../bin/prepare_other_frontend.sh) script.

It automatically clean ups the views (welcome page only) and sets up basic index.html into public folder. It also creates `frontend` which should be used for the React, Vue or any other frontend framework.
